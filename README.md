I created three starters: skeleton and wizard from start.vaadin.com and one from start.spring.io.
I ended up copying things from the wizard to the spring one. Skeleton adds lots of stuff, but then following the Hilla security documentation doesn't match.

Adding Hilla is not that hard, thanks to the automatic first view creation and some copy-paste from the wizard.

The first component I tried to use is a Select, but the suggested import was wrong (using VS Code).
