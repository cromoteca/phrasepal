### PhrasePal

PhrasePal is an application that helps you learn and practice phrases in different languages.

The learning cycle is:

1. **Learn**: you ask the application how to say something in a different language. It gives you a translation
    and remembers the key words in the phrase. You can learn as many phrases as you want.
2. **Practice**: you can practice the phrases you have learned. The application will ask you to translate a phrase
    from your native language to the target language, using the key words you have learned. You can practice
    as many phrases as you want.

It will be interesting to see how different AI models can handle the correction task.

Other possible features:

- Duolingo-like translation by clicking on shuffled words.
- Free chat with the AI.
- Speech recognition to avoid entering the phrases manually in learning mode.
- Speech recognition to evaluate the pronunciation. If such a service is not available, the alternative is to try to recognize the pronunciation in the target language and evaluate the text result, but that mixes pronunciation and translation.
